# Future Work
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to save, share, and revisit their past pitches.
- **Collaborative Pitches**: Allow multiple users to collaboratively refine a pitch in real-time.
- **Customization**: Allow users to select genres or themes for more tailored pitches.
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error-handling mechanisms for potential API disruptions and potential harmful content.
- **UI/UX**: Add animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
- **Multi-language Support**: Enable pitch generation in multiple languages.

# Reflections
- **What I'd do differently**: Integrate more diverse AI models to generate pitches that cater to various movie genres right from the start.
- **Trade-offs**: To maintain the project's simplicity, certain advanced features like user authentication and personalization have been left out.
